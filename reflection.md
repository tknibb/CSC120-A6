- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    - My initial impressions of inheritance were that it explains how you can get information from one class into another class if it is a subclass to a superclass. I was actually surprised at how easily I came to understand this relationship between classes. I am glad that I now know how to also change a method in a subclass that derived from a parent class. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    - What worked for me in understanding how to go about this assignment was reading through all the instructions carefully and working with others to brainstorm the best possible way to approach the code. The part of the code that we had trouble with the most was the hashtable and figuring out the methods that go along with it. My advice I'd give to someone taking this class in the future is to not stress too much, work with others, and utilize the office and TA hours.
